This is the Julia code for a bachelor thesis in applied mathematics by Logan Eriksson and Oscar Jemsson. 
The title for the thesis is "Uni -and bivariate interpolation of
multiscale data using cubic L1 splines".

L1 splines are an interpolation method that minimizes the 1-norm of the second derivative throughout all interpolation points.

1D directory contains the code for L1 splines in 1 dimension.

2D directory contains the code for L1 splines in 2 dimension.

Julia packages used: JuMP, HiGHS
