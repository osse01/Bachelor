This is the Julia code for a bachelor thesis in applied mathematics by Logan Eriksson and Oscar Jemsson. 
The title for the thesis is "Uni -and bivariate interpolation of
multiscale data using cubic L1 splines".

L1 splines are an interpolation method that minimizes the 1-norm of the second derivative throughout all interpolation points.
